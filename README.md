# JS Calculator App

### Description

- On this project we begin to take on more advanced JS functions.
- It can be seen at https://blue-velvet.netlify.app/

### What I Learned:

- More complex JavaScript functions with math.
- 

### What I am Proud Of:

- Made some advanced function for caluclating things like square root and inverse operations

### How I Would Uplevel It:

- I would make the UX better in the display showing a history of operations as they are input.
